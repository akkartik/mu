<span class="Comment">//: This project is setup to load all files with a numeric prefix. Just create</span>

<span class="Comment">//:</span>
<span class="Comment">//: The first few files (00*) are independent of what this program does, an</span>
<span class="Comment">//: experimental skeleton that will hopefully make it both easier for others to</span>
<span class="Comment">//: understand and more malleable, easier to rewrite and remould into radically</span>
<span class="Comment">//: different shapes without breaking in subtle corner cases. The premise is</span>
<span class="Comment">//: that understandability and rewrite-friendliness are related in a virtuous</span>
<span class="Comment">//: cycle. Doing one well makes it easier to do the other.</span>
<span class="Comment">//:</span>

<span class="Comment">//:   :(after &quot;more events&quot;)</span>
<span class="Comment">//: This directive means: insert the following lines after a line in the</span>
<span class="Comment">//: program containing the words &quot;more events&quot;.</span>
<span class="Comment">//:</span>
<span class="Comment">//: A simple tool is included to 'tangle' all the files together in sequence</span>
<span class="Comment">//: according to their directives into a single source file containing all the</span>
<span class="Comment">//: code for the project, and then feed the source file to the compiler.</span>
<span class="Comment">//: (It'll drop these comments starting with a '//:' prefix that only make</span>
<span class="Comment">//: sense before tangling.)</span>
<span class="Comment">//:</span>
<span class="Comment">//: Directives free up the programmer to order code for others to read rather</span>
<span class="Comment">//: than as forced by the computer or compiler. Each individual feature can be</span>
<span class="Comment">//: organized in a self-contained 'layer' that adds code to many different data</span>

<span class="Comment">//:</span>
<span class="Comment">//: Directives are powerful; they permit inserting or modifying any point in</span>

<span class="Comment">//:</span>
<span class="Comment">//: A single waypoint might have many different code fragments hooking into</span>
<span class="Comment">//: it from all over the codebase. Use 'before' directives to insert</span>
<span class="Comment">//: code at a location in order, top to bottom, and 'after' directives to</span>
<span class="Comment">//: insert code in reverse order. By convention waypoints intended for insertion</span>

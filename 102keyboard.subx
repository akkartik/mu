# check keyboard for a key
# return 0 on no keypress or unrecognized key

# We need to do this in machine code because Mu doesn't have global variables
# yet (for the keyboard buffer).

== code

# Most keys correspond to their ASCII/Unicode values.
# TODO: Support for international keyboards and multi-byte Unicode.
#
# However there are some exceptions that have no assigned place in Unicode
# (and with good reason):
#   0x80 = left arrow ←
#   0x81 = down arrow ↓
#   0x82 = up arrow ↑
#   0x83 = right arrow →
# These code points are not used by Unicode and their semantics are agreed to
# be context-sensitive: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C1_controls.
# Mu cannibalizes them in yet another non-standard way.

# Translate SubX files with debug information on Linux.
#
# Mu's core tooling has a gap:
#   0. The C++ translator 'subx translate' can generate debug information on
#   Linux or BSD or Mac, but doesn't support any syntax sugar.
#   1. The self-hosted translator 'translate' runs in emulated mode and can
#   run on Linux or BSD or Mac. However, syntax sugar passes (sigils and
#   calls) can be very slow to run emulated.
#   2. The self-hosted translator 'translate_subx' runs natively on Linux. It is
#   fast, but you get no trace for runs and zero error-checking on the code
#   emitted by sigils and calls. Which could still be buggy.
#
# This script is a hack to get the best of all worlds. We run natively what we
# must, and leverage as much debug information as possible. This arrangement
# is snappy but requires Linux just like 'translate_subx'. You also are on your
# own to mentally map desugared instructions in traces and error messages back
# to the original sources.

//: The goal of this skeleton is to make programs more easy to understand and
//: more malleable, easy to rewrite in radical ways without accidentally
//: breaking some corner case. Tests further both goals. They help
//: understandability by letting one make small changes and get feedback. What
//: if I wrote this line like so? What if I removed this function call, is it
//: really necessary? Just try it, see if the tests pass. Want to explore
//: rewriting this bit in this way? Tests put many refactorings on a firmer
//: footing.
//:
//: But the usual way we write tests seems incomplete. Refactorings tend to
//: work in the small, but don't help with changes to function boundaries. If
//: you want to extract a new function you have to manually test-drive it to
//: create tests for it. If you want to inline a function its tests are no
//: longer valid. In both cases you end up having to reorganize code as well as
//: tests, an error-prone activity.
//:
//: This file tries to fix this problem by supporting domain-driven testing
//: We try to focus on the domain of inputs the program should work on. All
//: tests invoke the program in a single way: by calling run() with different
//: inputs. The program operates on the input and logs _facts_ it deduces to a
//: trace:
//:   trace("label") << "fact 1: " << val;
//:
//: The tests check for facts:
//:   :(scenario foo)
//:   34  # call run() with this input
//:   +label: fact 1: 34  # trace should have logged this at the end
//:   -label: fact 1: 35  # trace should never contain such a line
//:
//: Since we never call anything but the run() function directly, we never have
//: to rewrite the tests when we reorganize the internals of the program. We
//: just have to make sure our rewrite deduces the same facts about the domain,
//: and that's something we're going to have to do anyway.
//:
//: To avoid the combinatorial explosion of integration tests, we organize the
//: program into different layers, and each fact is logged to the trace with a
//: specific label. Individual tests can focus on specific labels. In essence,
//: validating the facts logged with a specific label is identical to calling
//: some internal subsystem.
//:
//: Traces interact salubriously with layers. Thanks to our ordering
//: directives, each layer can contain its own tests. They may rely on other
//: layers, but when a test fails its usually due to breakage in the same
//: layer. When multiple tests fail, it's usually useful to debug the very
//: first test to fail. This is in contrast with the traditional approach,
//: where changes can cause breakages in faraway subsystems, and picking the
//: right test to debug can be an important skill to pick up.
//:
//: To build robust tests, trace facts about your domain rather than details of
//: how you computed them.
//:
//: More details: http://akkartik.name/blog/tracing-tests
//:
//: ---
//:
//: Between layers and domain-driven testing, programming starts to look like a
//: fundamentally different activity. Instead of a) superficial, b) local rules
//: on c) code [like http://blog.bbv.ch/2013/06/05/clean-code-cheat-sheet],
//: we allow programmers to engage with the a) deep, b) global structure of the
//: c) domain. If you can systematically track discontinuities in the domain
//: you don't care if the code used gotos as long as it passed the tests. If
//: tests become more robust to run it becomes easier to try out radically
//: different implementations for the same program. If code is super-easy to
//: rewrite, it becomes less important what indentation style it uses, or that
//: the objects are appropriately encapsulated, or that the functions are
//: referentially transparent.
//:
//: Instead of plumbing, programming becomes building and gradually refining a
//: map of the environment the program must operate under. Whether a program is
//: 'correct' at a given point in time is a red herring; what matters is
//: avoiding regression by monotonically nailing down the more 'eventful' parts
//: of the terrain. It helps readers new and old and rewards curiosity to
//: organize large programs in self-similar hiearchies of example scenarios
//: colocated with the code that makes them work.
//:
//:   "Programming properly should be regarded as an activity by which
//:   programmers form a mental model, rather than as production of a program."
